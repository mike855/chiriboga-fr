Under GPL 3.0 license.

This project has evolved over time. Originally it was a command-line style implementation (an in-browser console with text commands) of a subset of the cards in the FFG Core set. The approach was very experimental with no design or end goal in mind. At one point, training a DQN (Reinforcement Learning AI) was attempted and abandoned. Later a graphical interface was developed using pixi.js, during which the System Gateway set was released. Vestigial remnants of those older stages can probably still be found in the code.

Implements all cards in Null Signal Games' System Gateway and System Update 2021 sets. Chiriboga is not endorsed by Null Signal Games.
